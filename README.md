# Urban Design 3D City Dashboard with LLM Querying

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project is a full-stack web dashboard that visualizes Calgary city building data in 3D, supports natural language querying through LLM integration, and allows users to save and reload analysis projects.

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Three.js, Redux, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, MUI
- **Backend:** Flask, SQLite
- **LLM Integration:** Hugging Face Inference API (`T0pp` model)

## ðŸ“Œ Note on Dataset and Usable Filters

The dataset used in this project is derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints for Calgary city blocks. While the data includes valuable structural information, it does **not** include zoning or assessed property values as originally suggested.

However, the following attributes are available and can be used in natural language queries:

- `height`: Height of the building in meters
- `levels`: Number of floors/levels
- `type`: Type of building (`commercial`, `government`, `school`, etc.)

You can test the application using example queries like:

- "Highlight buildings taller than 20 meters"
- "Show buildings with more than 2 levels"
- "Show buildings whose type is commercial"

Please avoid queries related to residential zoning or monetary property values, as those attributes are not present in this dataset.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

### 1. 3D City Visualization
- Extrudes building footprints into 3D models based on height
- Interactive view with camera control and building click for popup info

### 2. Natural Language Query
- Input text like `"show buildings over 100 feet"`
- Backend sends it to Hugging Face API â†’ Parses into a JSON filter
- Buildings matching filter are highlighted

### 3. Project Persistence
- Enter a username to start
- Save projects (name + query + filter)
- View and reload saved projects with 1 click

## ðŸ§  How LLM Integration Works
1. User types: `highlight buildings over 100 feet`
2. Backend sends:  
Extract the filter from this query: highlight buildings over 100 feet.
Return JSON with 'attribute', 'operator', and 'value'
3. Response:  
{"attribute": "height", "operator": ">", "value": 100}
4. Filter is applied to 3D mesh â†’ Matching buildings highlighted
